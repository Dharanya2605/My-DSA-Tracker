  upper bound algorithm finds the first or the smallest index in a sorted array where the value at that index is greater than the given key i.e. x.

The upper bound is the smallest index, ind, where arr[ind] > x.

But if any such index is not found, the upper bound algorithm returns n i.e. size of the given array. 
The main difference between the lower and upper bound is in the condition. For the lower bound the condition was arr[ind] >= x and here, in the case of the upper bound, it is arr[ind] > x.
