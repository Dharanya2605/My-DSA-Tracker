### 🛤️ About This Journal

Yes, I’ve already started my DSA journey with full commitment — and this repository is my logbook, tracking my daily growth, consistency, and challenges.

Like how LeetCode streaks and competitive coding reflect commitment, this repo reflects mine — every problem, every concept, every note.

I’m proficient in **Arrays** and **Strings**, having solved **200+ problems** across both topics through platforms like LeetCode, GFG.

Now I’m diving deeper — starting with **Binary Search** and gradually progressing toward topics like Recursion, Linked Lists, Trees, and Graphs.

🔁 I’ve pledged to commit my learnings **every single day** — code, explanations, notes, and reflections.  
Whether it’s a solved problem, a new concept, or an interview pattern — it will live here, raw and real.
